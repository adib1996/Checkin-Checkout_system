<Known Bugs/ Errors>
1. Reports
- Deleted account's logs is viewable in the 'View all' datagrid view (Will look into options on how to keep it separated but not deleted)
- Exported file contains the date in the time section and vice versa
- Logs are not cleared after a month making exporting the CSV file larger and larger

2. User Interface
- Side menu's darken background just disappears immediately instead of fading out
- Window shell options (Drag, maximize, minimize, restore) are behind the forms and are not functional
- Maximising a screen actually makes it full screen, making the task bar inaccessible
